## George Best

George Best, affectionately known as the 'fifth Beatle', is remembered both for his off-the-field antics and his on-the-pitch achievements. His natural talent makes him the most gifted footballer the British and Irish Isles have ever produced. Some of his major achievements include:

- 1968 Ballon d'Or
- 1967/68 FWA Footballer of the Year
- 1967/68 Football League First Division top scorer
- 1968 European Cup
- Two Football League First Division titles

Best peaked early in his career, but what a peak it was. As he himself quoted, "Pele called me the greatest footballer in the world. That is the ultimate salute to my life."[[90min.com](https://www.90min.com/posts/50-greatest-footballers-all-time-ranked)]

## Johan Cruyff

Johan Cruyff is a mythical figure in football, arguably the most influential footballer of all time; and one of the most talented too. The centrepiece of the 'Total Football' era, Cruyff made beautiful teams successful; a feat so incredible that we still see its effects to this day. Some of his major achievements include:

- 1971, 1973 & 1975 Ballon d'Or
- 1974 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball
- FIFA World Cup All-Time Team

- Two-time Dutch Sportsman of the Year
- Three European Cups
- One La Liga title
- Nine Eredivisie titles
- One Copa del Rey
- Six KNVB Cup
- One Intercontinental Cup

It takes a special type of footballer to invent his own skill move - Aiden McGeady aside, obviously. [[90min.com](https://www.90min.com/posts/50-greatest-footballers-all-time-ranked)]
